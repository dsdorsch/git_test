    <p>
        Hi there! I love all things art and design and could talk about it all day! I am always focused for advocating for users 
        when desining but also giving them delight along the way. I like to be challenged everyday to keep on my toes and I am always 
        curious about how something can be improved upon. My portfolio has a wide range of art, because I am interested in all the 
        world has to offer in the way of design. Why look at only one aspect of style, when there are so many opportunities to craft 
        and illustrate?
